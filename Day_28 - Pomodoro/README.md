# Pomodora App
### Overview: ###
_________________
The Pomodora Technique effectively utilises the way that our braian works to take short breaks often and to work for 25mins at a time which helps us with information retention and keeping up the motivation.

How the program works:
- It's a timer with a tomato on it. When you click the start button, it tells you to work for 25 mins. The window can go to the background while you work.
- When the timer is up, it means the first Pomodora is completed. After every Pomodora is completed, a green checkmark shows.
- The window will pop to the very front of the screen above all the other windows and tell you to take a break. The first break is 5 mins long. 
- After completing four Pomodora's, you then get a 20 mins long break.
- These will continue untill the reset button is clicked, to stop and reset the timer.

Here's a screenshot of the GUI:
