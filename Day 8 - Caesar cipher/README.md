# Caesar Cipher

### Overview
This code lets you encode or decode a message using the method used during the times of Julius Caesar. You choose the amount of shifts you want to use to encode the message. As long as you or the other person know the amounts of shifts the message was encoded with, the message can easily be decoded/retrieved.
