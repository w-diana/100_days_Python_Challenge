# Password Manager (Updated)
### Overview: ###
_________________
Updated the Password Manager from Day 29. Levelled up the Password Manager from saving data in a txt file to a fancier data format, "JSON."
Basically the Password Manager helps create passwords and stores the passwords in a data.json file on your system. This allows you to have secure passwords and lets you check what those passwords are.

### Features of the password manager: ###
_________________________________________

- Has basic validation: It outputs an error to let you know a field is left empty. <p align="center">

- If you generate a passowrd, it saves it to your clipboard automatically so that it could be pasted easily.
  
- The GUI is made to be interactive with the user e.g. it highlights the entry box that the user is currently inputting information in.
  

### New added features of the password manager: ###
_________________________________________

- Has a search functionality, so we don't go digging through a json file to find out our email and password combinations for the websites we have stored. Here's an example of me searching for my saved Amazon email and password combination:<p align="center">

</p>

- Can now avoid duplicate saving. This means it does not let you save an email and password for a particular website more than once. Instead, it would ask if you want to update the current saved email and password combination for the website if it alrady has one savaed. <p align="center">
