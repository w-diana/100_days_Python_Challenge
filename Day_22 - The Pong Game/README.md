# The Pong Game
### Overview: ###
_________________
I recreated the famous arcade Pong game. This was done by using Object Oriented Programming, and applying Class Inheritance. It's a 2-player game where player 1 uses the "up" and "down" arrow keys to control their paddle and player 2 uses the "w" and "s" keys to control their paddle. The speed of the ball increases as each player hits the ball to increase the games difficulty level as the game progresses.
