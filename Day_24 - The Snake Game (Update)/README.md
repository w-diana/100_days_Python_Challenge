# The Snake Game (Update)
### Overview: ###
_________________
I updaed "The Snake Game" made in "Day_20 & 21" file. This new update keeps track of the pllayers high score. This was done by creating a text file to store the high score, and using Pyhon's Read and Write built-in function to update the text file. This way, even if the game is closed and reopened, the highest score obtained woud always remain.

Screenshot of the game's GUI:
