# U.S. State's Game
### Overview: ###
_________________
Can you name all 50 states in the U.S.?

How the Game works:
- As you name the states, the map updates and shows you were the state is located.
- If you get stuck, type "exit". This would end the game and output a csv file with all the remaining states you failed to write (or forgot).
