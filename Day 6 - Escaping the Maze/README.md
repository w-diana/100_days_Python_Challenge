# Escaping the Maze

### Overview
I solved the random generated maze problem at [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json). It's best to run the code at Reeborg to see the character's movement and to try it out for the different mazes that are generated randomly upon refresh.
